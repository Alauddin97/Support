            The concept of copy trading helps investors/traders follow professional traders and replicate their trades. Unlike Etoro or Zulu trade we are not brokers and don’t restrict our clients to a singLe broker. A user can choose his/her own broker and still copy our signals via broker API. 
Our Risk management feature and option to unsubscribe or not copy a signal sender at any given time in a single click makes us stand out from any other similar platforms
